This Cafe Website is a fully responsive and interactive web application designed to represent a modern café or coffee shop. The website showcases sections such as the homepage banner, about café details, menu categories, today’s specials, gallery, customer reviews, and a functional table-booking form. It demonstrates strong UI/UX design principles through clean layout, consistent styling, and mobile responsiveness. JavaScript is used to add dynamic behavior such as menu filtering, review sliders, and a responsive navigation bar. The booking system uses AJAX to submit user data without refreshing the page, creating a smooth user experience. On the backend, PHP processes the submitted form data, and the information can be stored either in a CSV file or a MySQL database, depending on the development setup. This project is ideal for learning full-stack fundamentals by combining frontend design, interactivity, and backend data handling in a practical real-world example.
